% TODO: Write abstract
This report presents the results of the Lufthansa Technik InnovAero competition.

% Everything from here must be included in 15 pages %
\chapter{Introduction}
% TODO: Introduction and brief overview of the used literature
Contrails (short for "condensation trails") are line-shaped clouds produced by aircraft engine exhaust or changes in air pressure, typically at aircraft cruising altitudes several kilometres/miles above the Earth's surface \cite{enwiki:1250066651}. Contrails trap longwave radiation, contributing to net positive radiative forcing. Persistent contrails can evolve into cirrus-like clouds, which enhance warming effects by trapping heat that would otherwise escape into space. Studies show that this radiative forcing from contrails may rival or exceed $CO_2$ emissions from aviation in the short term \cite{acp}. Hence, studying contrail formation and finding ways to avoid them is crucial for reducing the environmental impact of aviation. \\

This study relies on the theoretically established \textbf{Schmidt-Appleman Criterion} \cite{appleman1953formation} to predict the formation of contrails and the length associated with it. Basic assumptions made here in deriving this criterion are (1) contrails are composed of ice crystals; (2) water vapor cannot
be transformed into ice witzhout first passing through the liquid phase, thus necessitating an
intermediate state of saturation with respect to water. We will refer to some other studies and articles that propose the necessary equations used in thermodynamic calculations and argue upon their accuracy. \\

\chapter{Aircraft Components}
% TODO: Listing and representation of aircraft components for the aquisition of wheater data and in the future for the detection of contrails

\chapter{Component Installation}
% TODO: Description and illustration of how the components can be installed in the aircraft

\chapter{Calculation of Possible Contrail Formation}
% TODO: Calculation of the possible formation of contrails in the region under consideration

\chapter{Route Replanning}
% TODO: Demonstration of flight route re-planning to avoid contrails

\chapter{Conclusion}
% TODO: Conclusion and recommendations for further investigations
