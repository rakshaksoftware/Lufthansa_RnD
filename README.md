## Background

1. CLIMATE PROTECTION
2. When fly at high altitudes, the water vapor in the engine exhaust condenses with the cold ambient air at
high altitudes. This creates tiny water droplets or ice crystals that become visible as contrails when
reflected in sunlight. The formation of contrails depends on various factors, including the altitude of the aircraft, the humidity
and the temperature in the area. Contrails usually occur on aircraft flying at very high altitudes where the air
is very cold and dry. Under these conditions, water vapor can condense on particles from engine exhaust
and form contrails, which are often visible as long, narrow stripes of cloud in the sky.
The effects of contrails on the climate are the subject of scientific research. Although contrails vary in
duration and often dissipate, they can still enhance the formation of cirrus clouds. These airliner-induced
clouds can impact the climate by affecting the amount of sunlight that reaches or is reflected to Earth and
increasing the temperature in the atmosphere.
3. Development of efficient and low-emission aircraft models
4. Modernizing existing aircraft, for example to obtain additional aircraft data and environmental data. 
5. In summary, the combination of climate protection, development, aircraft construction and flight route optimization requires a holistic approach that takes into account both ecological and socio-economic aspects and relies on innovative solutions.
