The Aircraft Meteorological DAta Relay programme (AMDAR) collects and distributes the following meteorological data:
-  High-resolution vertical profiles of air **temperature**, **wind speed and direction** at *airports*; 
- Regular reports of meteorological variables **(what are these?)** from airplanes en route at cruise level;
- Accurate measurements of **coordinates** (time, latitude, longitude and pressure altitude);
- Measurements of **turbulence**;
- **Water vapour or humidity data** (*from some, suitably equipped aircraft*)

- Pressure sensors monitor the pressure in hydraulic systems, braking, raising and lowering landing gear, engine oil, oxygen tanks, heating and coolant fluids. Firms like Ester line Corp. and Custom Control Sensors make pressure sensors for aviation. 

- Position sensors such as linear variable differential transformers (LVDT) and rotary variable differential transformers (RVDT) sense the displacement of various aircraft components, including, for example, the deployment status of thrust reversers. 

- Temperature sensors monitor the conditions of hydraulic oils, fuels, refrigerants and environmental cooling systems. These sensors include bi-metallic temperature gauges, thermometers, Wheatstone bridge indicators, radiometers and thermocouples. Omega Engineering Inc. makes high-precision temperature sensors for reliable, easy-to-assemble, extended-life and pre-flight applications. Hydra-Electric makes pressure and temperature sensors based on the latest technology. 

- Flow sensors can be used to effectively monitor air flow into small gas engines used to power some aeroplane varieties. These help the engine CPU determine the proper fuel-to-air ratio at a specified engine speed, which results in improved power and efficiency, and reduced emissions. 

- Tachometers indicate engine rpm. Tachometer probes are used in turbine engines. These sense the changes in magnetic field flux density, as rotating gear wheels move at the same speed as compressor shafts travelling through the probes’ magnetic field. Resulting voltage signals are directly proportional to engine speed.

- Other aircraft instruments include aneroid barometers, direction indicators, artificial horizons, attitude indicators, laser sensors, sound sensors, IR and RF sensors, among others.

- Attitude heading and reference systems (AHRSes) have replaced most gyroscopes in modern aircraft. Data from MEMS devices, GPSes, magnetometers and accelerometers, and attitude information are received by AHRSes. Watson Industries also make AHRSes for aviation. 

- ALTIMETERS:  These measure changes in static air pressure to determine the altitude of the aircraft. For example, MS5803–02BA, based on MEMS technology, is a high-resolution altimeter sensor from TE Connectivity. It includes a high linearity pressure sensor and an ultra low power 24-bit ADC with internal factory-calibrated coefficients.

-  Thermocouple, RTD, Strain gauge are called analog sensors.

- Inertial measurement units utilise multi-axis magnetometers that are in essence small, accurate compasses. These sense changes in direction and feed data into a central processor, which ultimately indicates direction, orientation, and speed.
