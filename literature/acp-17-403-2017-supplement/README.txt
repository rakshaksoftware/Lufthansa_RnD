Explanations

1) COLI.xlsx

An Excel table, with a first line explaining the columns and then one line for each contrail observation, sorted by time of measurement.  The table content is described in this paper.

2) CSAE_Table.txt

An ASCII file, containing a table of CSAE Sabreliner mean values during contrail measurements behind a Learjet.

3) ACTA_2008_2009.txt

An ASCII file containing the ACTA results of Vázquez-Navarro et al. (2015). A header explains the columns.
The format should be consistent with the so-called NASA format specified in https://espoarchive.nasa.gov/content/Ames_Format_Specification_v20

4) ACTA_tau_percentiles.xlsx

An Excel table listing the percentile values of the ACTA-derived optical depth values tau, as derived from the data in ACTA_2008_2009.txt.

NR_TAUW = number of data for tau for given age interval
age/s =  center of age interval
y00_TAUW = minimum value
y10_TAUW = 10% percentile
y25_TAUW = 25% percentile
y50_TAUW = 50% percentiles (median value)
y75_TAUW = 75% percentile
y90_TAUW = 90% percentile
y100_TAUW = Maximum value 

5) CoCiP_CAM_percentiles.xlsx

An Excel table listing the percentile values of the CoCiP-CAM-derived contrail properties YYYY, as derived from output of the simulations described in Schumann et al. (2015; see also Appendix B of this paper), for the following properties  YYYY:

n_ice, the number of ice particles per cm3
ext, optical extinction per km-1
IWC, ice water mass concentration per m3
DEPTH = D, maximum contrail depth in m
WIDTH=W, width of contrail in m
Rmu = r_vol, volume mean radius in micrometer
TAUW = tau = optical depth at solar wavelengths 
Area = contrail cross-section area in km2
PMICEW = number of ice particles per contrail length in m-1
TAUWIDTH = EA = integral of optical depth over width in m
I =TWC = ice mass per contrail length in kg m-1

For each YYYY, the table provides:

NR_YYYY = number of data for given age interval
age/s =  center of age interval
y00_YYYY = minimum value
y10_YYYY = 10% percentile
y50_YYYY = 50% percentiles (median value)
y90_YYYY = 90% percentile
y100_YYYY = Maximum value 


Some minimum/maximum values for large ages (with few data) have been adjusted by hand for reasonable plotting. These values are rounded values.



6) Aircraft_types_Atlas_2006.txt

List if flight IDs. as referred to in Atlas et al. (2006), and corresponding aircraft types 


7) falcon_1991-04-09_f1797a_track.nas

ASCII file with Falcon flight track of 9 April 1991 (Baumann et al., 1993), with header explaining the columns, in NASA format (see above).
